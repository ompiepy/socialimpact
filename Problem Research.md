### Intro
*Most of the food that humans, insects and animals eat comes from angiosperms, or plants that make flowers. Vegetables like peas, tomatoes, peppers, sweet corn and broccoli are produced by angiosperms. Grains such as wheat, rice, barley, oats and rye are products of angiosperms, and fruits like apples, oranges and bananas all come from flowering plants too. 
*Insects are crucial to pollination, and without them, we would not have many of the fruits, nuts and vegetables we enjoy.
*In an article appearing in “BioScience,” experts John Losey and Mace Vaughan report that as much as 15 to 30 percent of the food eaten in the United States depends either directly or indirectly on pollinator animals. Additionally, they estimate the value of pollinator insects to crop production to be more than $3 billion annually.

### Project Type, Purpose, & Description
We will use an azure cognitive service to classify the flowers of a crop and determine the number of plants and know an approximate harvest that will be generated in order to predict whether it will be positive or regular.
