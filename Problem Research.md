### Intro
Most of the food that humans, insects and animals eat comes from angiosperms, or plants that make flowers. Vegetables like peas, tomatoes, peppers, sweet corn and broccoli are produced by angiosperms. Grains such as wheat, rice, barley, oats and rye are products of angiosperms, and fruits like apples, oranges and bananas all come from flowering plants too. Insects are crucial to pollination, and without them, we would not have many of the fruits, nuts and vegetables we enjoy. In an article appearing in “BioScience” experts *John Losey* and *Mace Vaughan* report that as much as **15 to 30 %** of the food eaten in the United States depends either directly or indirectly on pollinator animals. Additionally, they estimate the value of pollinator insects to crop production to be more than $3 billion annually.

There are various flowers such as Roses and Jasmine which have a good potential of export. This sector generates higher income and creates employment opportunities, especially for women. Currently, these flowers are classified manually based on their quality; this is a time-consuming process, in which the flowers **lose their freshness.** Thus, determining their quality has become more challenging. As these activities are performed manually and are **very labor intensive**, automation of flower-quality detection is a necessary task.

### Project Type, Purpose, & Description
We will use an Azure Cognitive Service to classify the flowers of a crop and know an approximate harvest duration that will be generated in order to predict whether it will be positive or regular. We will use image processing and classification to automate flower quality detection and disease inorder to reduce manpower intensity and able to export high-quality flowers. The proposed algorithm focuses on the color, shape and texture features combined to identify the flower quality.(suggestion: can addon leaf disease detection)
